This computer security competition, based on the principle of Capture The Flag, is a game made up of challenges carried out by teams of up to 4 students. The teams will have to solve in a given time challenges covering a wide variety of security problems: cryptography, reverse engineering, network security, web or mobile security, forensic analysis and wireless networks. The complexity of the challenges varies from obvious to really complex.

This experience allowed me and my team to take our first steps in the world of security as well as to realize its complexity.
