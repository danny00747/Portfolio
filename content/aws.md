AWS is short for Amazon Web Services. The world’s largest online book store also happens to run the world’s largest public cloud provider.

AWS offers PaaS (platform as a service), IaaS (infrastructure as a service), serverless computing, and much more, with well over 70 different services. And that number is growing rapidly as well, with AWS now offering more than a thousand new services and features every year

I took this course because i wanted to know if i could deploy easily my graduation work backend server on AWS.

- Through this course i was able to learn the following :

- Identify the main AWS services

- How Amazon EC2 works

- How Amazon RDS works

- How Amazon S3 works

Having gone through this course, i realised there is way too much to learn about AWS and i'm going to continue to do so for me to start deploying apps on AWS.
