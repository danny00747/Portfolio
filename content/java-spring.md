Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.

I took this course because i wanted to have a better understanding about the Spring framework since i planned to develop and use Spring as my graduation work backend server. 

Through this course i was able to learn the following: 

- Single responsibility principle

- Dependency inversion principle

- Understand what inversion of control and dependency injection are

- Learn the operation and general principles of Spring Framework

- Organize and build a project based on Spring using Maven
