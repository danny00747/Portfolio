DevOps is a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale. 

I took this course to help have a better understanding the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

This course is divided into two parts :

- Continuous integration (CI): planning the development of features, integrating different parts of the code, as well as testing and measuring the quality of the code.

- How to deploy your continuous code (CD) with Infrastructure-as-Code, and test, supervise your application once deployed!

Thanks to this course i was able to set up CI pipelines on GitHub for school and personal projects.
