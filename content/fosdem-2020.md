[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org "fosdem") is a completely free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
Each year, several thousand free and open source software developers from all over the world come together at this event which takes place in Brussels.

I was there for the first time in February 2019. Having found the experience very interesting, I returned in 2020.

In addition to the many presentations, stands can be used to share information, demonstration software or even sell merchandise, give gifts and, above all, for exhibitors to
introduce themselves to the many visitors.

These are some of the FOSDEM'20 conferences i was able to attend :
