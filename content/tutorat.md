During my second year at EPHEC i was fortunate to be a tutor who provides assistance on the programming course given to 1st grade students at EPHEC in IT. 

Through this experience i was able to somehow better understand JavaScript because to explain to something to students, you have to understand it first and that's what i did. I made sure the concept was well understood before i tried to explain it.
