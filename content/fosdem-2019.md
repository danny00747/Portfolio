[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org "fosdem") is a completely free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
Each year, several thousand free and open source software developers from all over the world come together at this event which takes place in Brussels.

A friend told me about the FOSDEM conferences at the end of 2018.
Seeing the interest in this event, I directly watched the conferences and speeches planned to make a list of everything that interested me.
Unfortunately, some conferences were taking place at the same time as others, so I had to choose among them.

These are some conferences i was able to attend during FOSDEM 2019:
