This an online conference on TEAMS organised by WireHack which goal was to connect and present different leading IT companies in Belgium. 

During this conference the [SMALS](https://www.smals.be "smals") team shared their experience:

- The projects they are working on
- Tips and guidances
- Job opportunities, and much more!

<br>

This conference helped me get a much better understanding of some of the leading IT companies operate in Belgium.
